## About

Thanks for visit my personal page, my name is Miguel Angel Asencio Hurtado and I'm a colombian data scientist, web developer, and soon the CEO of my own start up.

For me it's really interesting all the tech areas, so you could talk to me about some physics, chemestry and maths, but also about circuits, language programms, machine learning, etc.

I'm an enthusiast about data science and MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), for example, I'm currently working in a free software machine learning tool for javascript, called [ml.js](https://github.com/mljs/ml), I'm co-organizer of the meetup [Big Data & Data science Bogota](http://www.meetup/Big-Data-Science-Bogota), and I'm reading daily about those topics and taking MOOCs about it.

As a good geek, I'm (really) bad saying not to an interesting project, so if you want somethink that you would like to do, or if you just want to have a talk, please [contact me](#contact).
