## Welcome!
Hello! my name is Miguel Angel Asencio Hurtado, and this is my first blog entry, so it's more like a "hello world", a welcome post and a short autobiography.

The main goal for this blog is have some cheat-sets for the future, so if I found something interesting I'll try to explain it in the most simple but complete way, because in a (probably near) future I wont remember it and I would like to have a simple and complete information about it.

### Early life and education
I was born in September 10th of 1992 in Bogotá, Colombia. I studied my school in the Refous school (Colegio Refous), where I was shocked by all the mathematics concepts and all the physics fields, specially by the electromagnetic area.

My first taught was that my degree should be electronics engineering, so I start studying in 2010 in the Nacional University of Colombia (Universidad Nacional de Colombia), but with the time and study I found my passion in the programming and artificial intelligence fields, so I got the risk and choose to change to computer science (in Colombia is called Systems engineering), and to be honest, is one of the best decisions I've took.

Parallel to my bachelor in computer science I found one of my biggest addictions, the MOOCs. I've currently more than 20 certifications and maybe I've done more than other 20 not-certified courses, so I just love them. In this courses I've learned about a lot of topics, the most relevant ones are about machine learning, MongoDB for DBAs and developers, mobile development for Android, IOS8 and hybrid apps, artificial intelligence, data mining and javascript tools.

I also a big fan of free software, I did a "free software for entrepreneurship diploma" (Diplomado en software libre para emprendimento) and I've been involved as collaborator of a [machine learning organization in javascript](https://github.com/mljs/ml), where I developed 16 NPM packages with [more than 14000 downloads](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=maasencioh&from=&to=) and have the opportunity of doing a internship in the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html).

### Honors and awards
  - Selected project in the day of projects and works by the COMFIE program of National University of Colombia in the 2014 version.
  - Selected entrepreneurship project in the "free software for entrepreneurship diploma" and presented in the FLISOL event in 2014.
