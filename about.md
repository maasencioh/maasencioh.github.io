Thanks for visit my personal page, my name is Miguel Angel Asencio Hurtado and I’m a colombian data scientist, web and mobile developer.

For me it’s really interesting all the tech areas, so you could talk to me about some physics, chemistry and maths, but also about circuits, language programs, machine learning, etc.

I’m an enthusiast about data science and MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), for example, I’m currently working in a free software machine learning tool for javascript, called {% include icon-github.html username="mljs/ml" %}, I’m co-organizer of the meetup [Big Data & Data science Bogota](http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Science-Bogota) and organizer of the meetup [BeerJS Bogota](http://www.meetup.com/Beer-JS-Bogota), and I’m reading daily about those topics and taking MOOCs about it.

As a good geek, I’m (really) bad saying not to an interesting project, so if you have something that you would like to do, or if you just want to have a talk, please [contact me](/contact).
